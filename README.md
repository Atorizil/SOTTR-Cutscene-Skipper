This is a really simple mod to force skip any cutscene in Shadow of the Tomb Raider by pressing Ctrl + Spacebar


There is a skip delay of roughly 5 seconds so the game doesn't softlock in some way. If there are any issues at a specific cutscene, create an [Issue](https://github.com/Atorizil/SOTTR-Cutscene-Skipper/issues).


## Note

This application is really basic because I am hoping to replace this with a simple patcher that will permanently apply this
