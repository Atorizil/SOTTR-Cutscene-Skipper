# SOTTR Cutscene Skipper
This is a external hack for Shadow of the Tomb Raider which allows many of the unskippable cutscenes to be skipped.

 **Only works for Version 234.1** ([Downgrade Guide](https://www.speedrun.com/trshadow/guide/4yi80))
 
 **[Download from Releases](https://github.com/Atorizil/SOTTR-Cutscene-Skipper/releases)**
 
## Usage
Once you have downloaded the executuble from releases, just open it and leave it running in the background. By pressing `Spacebar`, as you normally would, the hack will try to skip the cutscene. There are a number of conditions to prevent crashing and softlocks:
- There is a skip delay of roughly 5 seconds.
- There is a blacklist of cutscenes that need to remain unskippable.
  - This blacklist also contains cutscenes that need a longer delay before they can be skipped.
- Cutscenes that do not show a loading icon cannot be skipped.

## Other Notes
If there are any issues at a specific cutscene, create an [Issue](https://github.com/Atorizil/SOTTR-Cutscene-Skipper/issues).
